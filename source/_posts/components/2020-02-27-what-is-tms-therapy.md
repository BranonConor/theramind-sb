TMS is a non-invasive, safe and effective treatment option for people suffering from drug resistant depression. FDA’s clearance of the clinical use of TMS therapy in
October, 2008, provided a groundbreaking new treatment alternative for physicians and
their depression patients. Within two years, TMS had become so accepted by the
medical community as an effective treatment for depression that the American
Psychiatric Association began recommending TMS as a second-line treatment for
depression.


TMS has also been used safely and effectively used for several other conditions,
including: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD); Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD); Chronic Pain (including Fibromyalgia); Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
(“OCD”); Tinnitus; and other mood and neurological disorders. Please refer to our
Treated Disorders page for more information. The TheraMind Center of Los Angeles
successfully treats Major Depressive Disorder and OCD sufferers using the Brainsway
TMS system, including the new FDA-approved Brainsway OCD TMS therapy system.

## A GENERAL TMS TREATMENT COURSE AND SIDE EFFECTS

TMS treatment is an outpatient procedure and requires no anesthesia or sedation. A
typical depression treatment course consists of at least thirty treatments, usually five
treatments a week for six weeks, although the treatment schedule can vary based on
patient response. The procedure typically lasts about 19 minutes during which time the
patients are awake, alert and comfortable. Our TMS Specialists are present throughout
the treatment and interact with the patient while continuously monitoring the treatment
to ensure the patient’s comfort and the maximum efficacy of the treatment.


For depression and mood disorder therapy, TMS uses rapid magnetic pulses to
stimulate nerve cells in the area of the brain known to control mood. The magnetic
pulses make a clicking sound and feel like a mild tapping on the scalp. Typical TMS
side effects are transient; the most common being mild irritation and discomfort of the
scalp and headaches.
